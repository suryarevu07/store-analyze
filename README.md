# Department-Wide Sales Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting department-wide sales for each store for the upcoming year and analyzing the effects of markdowns during holiday weeks. Additionally, it provides actionable recommendations to maximize business impact based on the insights drawn. 

## Objectives

1. *Sales Prediction*: Build a model to forecast department-wide sales for each store for the following year.
2. *Markdown Analysis*: Analyze the effects of markdowns during holiday weeks to determine their impact on sales.
3. *Recommendations*: Provide actionable insights and recommendations, prioritizing those with the largest potential business impact.

## Project Approach

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collect historical sales data, markdown data, holiday information, and any other relevant features.
- Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Engineer features such as holiday indicators, markdown percentages, and seasonality factors.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies in sales data.
- Analyze the relationship between markdowns and sales during holiday weeks.
- Examine sales patterns across different stores and departments.

### Step 3: Sales Prediction Model
- Use time-series forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet) or machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM) to predict department-wise sales for the next year.
- Split the data into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or MAPE.

### Step 4: Markdown Effect Analysis
- Build a regression or causal inference model to quantify the effect of markdowns on sales during holiday weeks.
- Use hypothesis testing to confirm statistical significance.

### Step 5: Actionable Recommendations
- Identify key drivers of sales and markdown effectiveness.
- Provide prioritized recommendations to improve sales, focusing on the largest potential business impact.

### Step 6: Visualization and Reporting
- Create clear and interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit.
- Present findings and recommendations to stakeholders in a concise report.

## Tools and Technologies

- *Programming Languages*: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
- *Visualization*: Tableau, Power BI, or Matplotlib
- *Machine Learning*: XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, ARIMA/SARIMA
- *Deployment*: Streamlit for interactive dashboards
- *Version Control*: Git and GitHub

## Results and Insights

1. *Sales Prediction*:
   - Forecasted department-wise sales for the next year with an accuracy of XX%.
   - Identified peak seasons and departments with significant sales growth potential.

2. *Markdown Analysis*:
   - Markdown increases sales during holiday weeks by approximately XX%.
   - Departments A, B, and C benefit the most from markdowns.

3. *Recommendations*:
   - Increase markdowns strategically during holiday weeks for high-performing departments.
   - Optimize inventory based on forecasted sales to reduce overstocking and stockouts.
   - Focus on stores and departments with the highest potential for revenue growth.
